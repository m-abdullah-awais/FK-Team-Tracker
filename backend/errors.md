Here is a list of common HTTP status codes (error codes) that you can use in the backend to handle errors and successful responses. These codes are part of the standard HTTP specification and are widely used in RESTful APIs.

### 1. **Success Codes:**
- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server responded with the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource has been created (often used after POST).
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there's no content to return (e.g., after a DELETE request).
  
### 2. **Redirection Codes:**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (Temporary Redirect)**: The resource has temporarily moved to a new URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request (used for caching).

### 3. **Client Error Codes:**
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax (e.g., missing parameters, invalid JSON).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires authentication, or the authentication provided is invalid.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it (e.g., the user doesn't have the necessary permissions).
- **404 Not Found**: The server could not find the requested resource (e.g., incorrect endpoint or ID).
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The HTTP method used is not supported by the resource (e.g., using GET where POST is expected).
- **406 Not Acceptable**: The requested resource is not capable of generating content acceptable according to the `Accept` header in the request.
- **408 Request Timeout**: The server timed out waiting for the clientâ€™s request.
- **409 Conflict**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict (e.g., trying to create a duplicate resource).
- **410 Gone**: The requested resource is no longer available and will not be available again.
- **411 Length Required**: The server requires the `Content-Length` header to be specified.
- **412 Precondition Failed**: The server does not meet one of the preconditions specified in the request.
- **413 Payload Too Large**: The request payload is too large for the server to process.
- **414 URI Too Long**: The URI requested by the client is too long for the server to process.
- **415 Unsupported Media Type**: The server does not support the media type of the request.
- **416 Range Not Satisfiable**: The server cannot return the requested byte range.
- **417 Expectation Failed**: The server cannot meet the requirements of the `Expect` header in the request.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The server understands the request, but it was unable to process the contained instructions (e.g., invalid data format).
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).

### 4. **Server Error Codes:**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request (generic error).
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.
- **505 HTTP Version Not Supported**: The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.

### 5. **Custom Error Codes:**
These are not part of the HTTP standard but are sometimes used for more specific application-level errors.
- **422 Validation Error**: A custom code for validation errors in the input data.
- **5000 Database Error**: Custom error for database-specific errors (e.g., connection failure).
- **1001 Resource Not Found**: A custom error code indicating that a specific resource was not found.

---

### Summary:
You typically use:
- **2xx** codes for successful operations.
- **4xx** codes for client-side errors (bad request, not found, unauthorized).
- **5xx** codes for server-side errors (internal server error, service unavailable).

### Recommendations:
- **200** for success responses.
- **400** or **422** for invalid input.
- **404** for not found errors.
- **401** or **403** for authentication/authorization issues.
- **500** for unexpected server errors.

Using the appropriate HTTP status code helps make your API more RESTful and ensures that clients can properly handle errors based on the status of the request.
